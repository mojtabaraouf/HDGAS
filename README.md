 Hydrodynamic simulations of the Disk of Gas Around Supermassive black holes 


A description of the model and its default calibration results can be found in Raouf et al. (2023, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.524..786R/abstract). 

We present hydrodynamic simulations of the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM) gas influenced by the feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN), coupled with the CHIMES code to treat the radiative cooling, AGN heating, and chemistry. We focus on the central 200 pc around the black hole (BH) where the AGN outflows and radiation couple to the ISM. By making an Adaptive Mesh Refinement grid model and radiative transfer for a given geometrical distribution of gas and/or dust, we attempt to discern between the conflicting explanations for the apparently counterrotating gas in the AGN-dominated galaxy NGC 1068.

Please email me to access the generated snapshots output or radiative transfer fits files for any comparisonal studies.
